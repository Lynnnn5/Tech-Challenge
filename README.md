# Tech-Challenge
- This is a simple web app using Tomcat
- Can be accessed by https://glacial-lake-73459.herokuapp.com/
- All public endpoints are in class “Bank” (in “model” package)
- Stored all data in memory, using a class named “inMemoryStorage” as a “database”.
- When a wallet is created, two accounts named “spend account” and “growth account” are automatically created for this virtual wallet.
- This is not a well-functioned online bank, only covers functions mentioned in the challenge description. Since only the back-end library is required, didn’t check every illegal input at front end(such as input text to amount box).
